# ORTEX Login

This is my solution for the [TechnicalTask](https://public.ortex.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TechnicalTask.pdf "TechnicalTask form ORTEX") from ORTEX.

## Description

This project is made using ReactJS, JavaScript, CSS, React-router-dom, React-icon, React-loader-spinner and Firebase.

## How to use it?

First you need to clone this project.

```git
git clone https://github.com/JoseAMota11/ortex-login.git
```

Then you should have a file with the project. Once you open the project on VS Code navigate to the directory on your terminal and type:

```npm
npm i
```

> (You need to have NodeJS installed)

Once you have **node_modules** installed, go to your terminal and type the next command:

```npm
npm run dev
```

Finally, open the browser on **http://localhost:5173**
